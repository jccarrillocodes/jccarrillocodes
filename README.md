# Welcome to jccarrillo's repository

Technology is something amazing, it evolves in a blink of an eye and I wouldn't like to miss a bit, therefore every framework or tech that
catches my eye, I'll try and play with it, that's the way! I'll drop here some experiments.

If you're interested in knowing more about me:
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jccarrillocodes
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Android, Raspberry Pi, Arduino and sometimes in backends
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flutter since it caught my eye, despite the fact that I tried Cordova, Ionic or React Native, Flutter seems to me more promising and challenging
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via email at cto@jccarrillo.es

## Happy coding
